/**
 * \brief The class modelling the motor for the attachment device of the
 *        MarXbot
 *
 * This class models the motors for the attachment device of the MarXbot. The
 * device has two degrees of freedom: the orientation (i.e. where it is relative
 * to the robot turret) and the status, that is whether the device is open,
 * half-closed or closed.
 * Regarding orientation, it is possible to control it by position or by
 * velocity. In both cases the movement is never faster than a maximum speed
 * (that can be changed).
 * When the attachment device is open, it can be rotated using this motor. If it
 * is half-closed or closed and the robot is actually attached to another robot,
 * the motor controlling the rotation is disabled and the attachment device
 * rotates freely. Moreover every command to the attachment device (e.g.
 * setDesiredPosition, setDesiredVelocity...) is ignored. If instead the robot
 * is not attached to another robot, the device behaves normally (as if the
 * attachment device was open).
 * Given two robots A and B, A attaches to B if the following requirements are
 * satisfied:
 * 	- the attachment device of A is in contact with the turret of B and the
 * 	  attachment device of B is far from the turret of A. In other words the
 * 	  two attachment devices must not be in contact;
 * 	- the attachment device of A was in the open status in the previous
 * 	  timestep and is switched to half-closed or closed status in this
 * 	  timestep.
 * The attachment is instantaneous (i.e. it happends in one timestep). The
 * status of the device after the attachment determines how the two robots can
 * move with respect to each other: if it is closed, B cannot rotate its
 * attachment device (a fixed joint is added between the attachment device of A
 * and the turret of B); if it is half-closed, B can rotate its attachment
 * device with the limitation that it can collide with the attachment device of
 * A and so a 360Â° rotation is not possible (a hinge is added between the
 * attachment device of A and the turret of B).
 * To detach, a robot simply has to change the status of its attachment device
 * to open.
 * This motor only works for dynamic robots. For the attachment process to be
 * successful, both robots must be dynamical and have the attachment device
 * enabled. If the robot attachment device is not enabled, changes to the device
 * status are not applied
