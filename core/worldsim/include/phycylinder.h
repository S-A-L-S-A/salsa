 * To set a single color for the whole cylinder, simply use WObject::setColor
 * with a valid color. More precisely, as soon as you use one of the functions
 * defined here to set colors (setUpperBaseColor, setLowerBaseColor or
 * setSegmentsColor) those colors are used to draw the cylinder and the
 * WObject::color property is set to an invalid color (the color of other parts
